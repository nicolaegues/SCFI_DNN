Classifies whether a strain (in this case E.coli) is resistant (1) or susceptible (0) when treated with Kanamycin, Trimethorpim, and Gentamycin, 
based on data gathered from the Sub-Cellular fluctuation technique developed at the University of Bristol. 

NEEDED for the code to run: Folder with the saved arrays of the input parameters, as well as the experimental spreadsheets generated from running Arthur's code.
